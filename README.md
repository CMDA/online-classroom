> ðŸ“– A (technical) guide on how to virtual classroom

## Description

These are technical guides on how to set-up software and hardware to create a _online classroom_ experience for students. It also explores some ways on how to make your _screencasts_ more professional.

The guides mainly focus on technical courses, since we write about setting up your code editor for example but most principles can be applied to non-technical courses.

All the supporting material used for writing these guides can be found in [`resources.md`](/resources.md).
